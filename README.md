# Reporting Bugs
Thank you for helping us test Aurous. We’re happy to have you on the team! We need people who can troubleshoot issues patiently and communicate them clearly. As you probably know, good bug reporting takes some time and effort. If you’re fine with that, then let’s get started!

Found a bug already? Wonderful! We’d love to hear about it — but first you should check around to make sure you’re not wasting your time on a known issue:

* Search through existing issues [here](https://github.com/AurousGroup/Bug-Tracker/issues)

If you’ve searched thoroughly and come up empty-handed, we’ll welcome your report. If it’s just a simple issue (a misspelled word or graphics glitch, for example) skip to the next paragraph. But if you’re seeing errors, or something is clearly broken, we’ll need you to gather some information first. Collect as much info as you can!


Okay, time to get writing. Head back to the issues page and start a new discussion. Be sure to give it a title that’s clear and concise, and then explain the problem thoroughly. Don’t forget to mention:

* What you were doing when the problem occurred
* All the information you gathered while troubleshooting
* Anything you can tell us about your computers environment

Copy any messages to a text file and jot down a few notes about when the error occurred, what you were doing at the time, and so on. Be sure to include any insights you may have gleaned about the conditions under which the issue does and doesn’t occur. Add as much information as possible about your computers environment: OS, flavor, version,, et cetera.

Once you have gathered all the information you can about the problem, you’re ready to file a bug report. 


Thank you @flarum for these rich guidelines.
